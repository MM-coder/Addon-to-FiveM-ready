# Addon file => FiveM Ready
Converts a 'dlc.rpf' GTAV addon file to a FiveM ready one, separating data and stream files into separate folders. Also offers the option to customize the spawncode and the in-game name


## Quickstart
Note: Windows only, the `gtautil` download *needs* to be version 2.2.7
1. [GO HERE](https://github.com/indilo53/gtautil/releases/tag/2.2.7) and download `gtautil-2.2.7.zip`
2. Unzip the download file, copy/cut the resulting folder to your %ProgramFiles% directory.
3. Run the .exe or the .py file to use the program.<br>NOTE: If you choose to use the .py file, use Python 3.9 in the native python.exe window. If you use an IDE like VSCode, it will not work.
